# ShopifyBackendChallengeGUI
This is my entry for the Shopify Backend Dev Challenge (2022). This version includes a GUI. 
Please check out my console version as well if you are interested: https://github.com/jessicaz831/ShopifyBackendChallengeConsole

Unfortunately, I don't know how to make it a web application, but I hope it's something.

INSTRUCTIONS:

To run the application:
1. Click on BackendDevChallenge.exe
2. Download the file
3. Run the file - your computer might say it's dangerous but I promise it isn't

To view my code (on GitHub): 
Navigate to BackendDevChallenge > Form1.cs
            BackendDevChallenge > Item.cs
           
OR if you are familiar with Visual Studio you can download the whole GitHub file as a .zip and 
   open BackendDevChallenge.sln in Visual Studio and run the application or view the code there
